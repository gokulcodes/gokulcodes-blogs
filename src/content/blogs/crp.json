Here, CSSOM Tree is Created\n- Once both DOM and CSSOM tree's created, Render tree is created\n- Render Tree will contain only elements which are visible in the UI\n- After Render Tree, layout calculations are carried out to know which elements are to be painted on pixels in the viewport. This process is called as Reflow.\n- Once calculations are done, Layering and Compositing steps will kick in to paint the actual elements on the viewport. This process is called Repaint."
